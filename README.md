# JS line break removal
This is a simple JS + HTML snippet that removes the line breaks from pasted text.

## What it does
* Gives a blank page with a text area spanning over entire page
* When you paste any text (paragraph), it will remove the line breaks and automatically copy this edited text in your clipboard.

This script is useful if you need to frequently copy and paste text from one source to other and are annoyed with unwanted line breaks :)
